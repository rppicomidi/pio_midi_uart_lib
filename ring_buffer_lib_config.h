/**
 * @file ring_buffer_lib_config.h
 * @brief Put your custom configuration #defines for the ring buffer library here
 *
 * In this example, the ring buffers are only used for UART1, so a buffer can only
 * be changed in the UART1 IRQ handler context and the main non-IRQ context. Therefore,
 * critical sections only have to manage the the UART1 IRQ, not all IRQs.

#ifndef RING_BUFFER_LIB_CONFIG
#define RING_BUFFER_LIB_CONFIG

// You can define a larger ring buffer size type if you want
// RING_BUFFER_SIZE_TYPE has to be able to hold a value less
// than or equal to the maximum number of bytes in a ring buffer
// Uncomment and modify the next line if the default (uint8_t)
// is not big enough
// #define RING_BUFFER_SIZE_TYPE uint8_t

// If you don't need to support multiple cores modifying the
// ring buffer, set RING_BUFFER_MULTICORE_SUPPORT to 0; it
// will save time and space
// Otherwise set it to 1. Uncomment the next line to enable
// multicore support
// #define RING_BUFFER_MULTICORE_SUPPORT 1

// If RING_BUFFER_MULTICORE_SUPPORT is 0, then safe version
// of ring buffer calls by default disable all IRQs on the
// current core, manipulate the buffer, and then restore IRQs.
// That is probably overkill for most applications. For
// example, if you are using this ring buffer with a peripheral
// driver, you can store the IRQ number to disable in the
// critical_section_data field of the ring_buffer structure
// in the ring_buffer_init() function call and then use
// that value to enable or disable only that peripheral IRQ.
// Uncomment the example below to do that
